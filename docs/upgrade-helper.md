From the readme of [its dedicated repo](https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-helper#-how-it-works):

> The Upgrade Helper tool aims to provide the full set of changes happening between any two versions, based on the previous work done in the rn-diff-purge project:

> > This repository exposes an untouched React Native app generated with the CLI react-native init RnDiffApp. Each new React Native release causes a new project to be created, removing the old one, and getting a diff between them. This way, the diff is always clean, always in sync with the changes of the init template.
